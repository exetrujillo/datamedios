## Additional comments for CRAN

The package facilitates automated extraction and processing of news articles from Chilean media outlets (initially focusing on BioBio.cl) and is specifically designed to handle Spanish-language content.

Since the package is aimed at Spanish-speaking users who work with Chilean media data, the function names, parameters, and documentation are written in Spanish. This ensures clarity and accessibility for the intended audience, as the use of the native language is essential for proper understanding and usability.

The package was developed by:

-   Exequiel Trujillo (Maintainer, [exequiel.trujillo\@ug.uchile.cl](mailto:exequiel.trujillo@ug.uchile.cl){.email})
-   Ismael Aguayo ([ismael.aguayo\@ug.uchile.cl](mailto:ismael.aguayo@ug.uchile.cl){.email})
-   Klaus Lehmann ([klehmann\@fen.uchile.cl](mailto:klehmann@fen.uchile.cl){.email})

We conducted thorough testing of the package on multiple devices and environments, including GitHub Actions, without encountering any issues. All examples, tests, and documentation were validated successfully to ensure compliance with CRAN policies.

If there are any adjustments or additional requirements needed to meet CRAN standards, please let me know. I am committed to making any necessary changes promptly.

Thank you for considering `datamedios` for CRAN. I look forward to your feedback.
